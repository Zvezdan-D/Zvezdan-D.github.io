This is information about the enhanced version of the Queue List add-on, which works with <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey</a> v2.x-4.x (MM 3.1.0.1223 or higher is recommended, v4.1.0.1648 or higher is even better, and there is also <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/QueueListMM5.html">version</a> of the add-on that works with MM v5). It is  similar to the Queue option of Winamp, i.e. it allows you to create a list with files that will be played immediately after the currently playing file, no matter if Shuffle is turned on or off.<br /><br />

The list of queued files is a simple playlist under the Playlists branch, which enables easy manipulation of its files (move up/down, remove) as with any other playlist. When a file from this queue list starts playback, it is automatically removed from that list. After all files from the queue list finish playback, the program continues with the reproduction of the remaining files from the Now Playing panel.<br /><br />

When the shuffle mode is turned on and the repeat mode is turned off, the randomized playing list is kept intact after playback of queued files, so that all files from the Now Playing panel will be played just once.<br /><br />

<dl>
<dt>v2.0 - 2022-04-20</dt><ul>
<li>Added: option DuplicatesMode to the <a href="#inikeys">INI file</a> that determines what happens when you apply the <i>Queue Selected</i> command with files that already exist in the Queue List playlist;
<li>Added: option RemoveFromNPAfterPlay to the INI file that determines what happens with files added to the Now Playing panel after applying the <i>Queue Selected</i> command with files that don't exist in the Now Playing panel when they finish playing;
<li>Fixed: playback of the remaining files after the queue was played in normal mode (when the shuffle is turned off);
<li>Fixed: automatic adding to the Now Playing list of manually added files to the Queue List by drag&drop or copy/paste, but only with MM v4.1.0.1648 or higher.
</ul><br />

<p><font size="+1"><b><a id="installation">Installation</a></b></font></p>
<ul><li>For MediaMonkey 3.0 or higher - just double-click on the QueueList-xx.mmip file; if you are on Vista or Win7 and you got "Product installation error", make sure you have MM3 set to <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/support/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/58/0/extensions-cannot-be-installed">"Run as Administrator"</a>; if you downloaded the installation package with IE7 and it changed its extension to a .zip, you should first change it back to a .mmip.</li>
<li>For MediaMonkey 2.x - rename a .mmip extension to a .zip, extract the QueueList.vbs file to the MediaMonkey's "Scripts\Auto" folder and restart MM program.</li></ul>

You need to accept the license agreement if you want to use this add-on.<br /><br />

<p><font size="+1"><b><a id="usage">Usage</a></b></font></p>
Files that you want to play in sequence after the current one can be selected in the main filelist or in the Now Playing panel. Adding selected files to the Queue List can be done by press of F3 hotkey, or it could be done by the <i>Queue Selected</i> command from the main Play menu, or by the same command in the context menu of the main filelist/Now Playing panel.<br /><br />

The Queue List, which contains files that are waiting to be played, is a simple playlist with that name inside the Playlists branch. You could create it manually, or it will be created automatically when you apply the <i>Queue Selected</i> command. The limitation of the add-on is that you cannot have another playlist with that name, unless you have an unique path to it specified in the QueuePlaylist <a href="#inikeys">INI key</a>.<br /><br />

If you apply the <i>Queue Selected</i> command on the selected files in the main filelist that don't already exist in the Now Playing panel, these files will be automatically added to the end of the Now Playing panel, otherwise they cannot be played. Also, if you apply the <i>Queue Selected</i> command on the selected files in the Now Playing panel that are not already added to the Library, these files will be added to it automatically. The same apply if you use drag&drop or copy/paste to add files to the Queue List playlist instead of the <i>Queue Selected</i> command.<br /><br />

Since the Queue List is a regular MM playlist, you could add/remove files to it manually e.g. by drag&drop or copy/paste as with any playlist, without using the <i>Queue Selected</i> command at all. Also, you can reorder files in it as you wish. However, manually adding files to the Queue List doesn't automatically add missing files to the Now Playing panel with MM older than v4.1.0.1648, so with these older versions you should use the <i>Queue Selected</i> command instead of drag&drop.<br /><br />

If you press "F4" hot-key, you will get displayed the Queue List playlist; if you press that hot-key again you will go back to the previous view.<br /><br />

If you have one or more files in the Queue List that are not already played and if you restart the program, that playlist will keep its content and the playback will resume with them until the Queue List finishes empty.<br /><br />

When you apply the <i>Queue Selected</i> command on a file that already exists in the Queue List, what happens next depends on the DuplicatesMode <a href="#inikeys">INI key</a>: such file could be skipped, it could be added again making duplicates in the list (behavior of the freely available version), or it could be removed similarly as with Winamp (default in this version of the add-on).<br /><br />

After the program finishes with the reproduction of the currently playing file, it will automatically start playback of files from the Queue List. When the file from this list starts playback, it is automatically removed from it. When all files from the Queue List are played, that playlist will end up empty, and the program will continue with the reproduction of the remaining files from the Now Playing panel.<br /><br />

This add-on allows playing files from the Now Playing files just once, including files added from the queue. In another words, not a single file should be skipped or played twice. Using the shuffle mode, for example, if you have 5 files in the Now Playing panel and if you played 2 files before you added other files to the Queue List, after these files from that queue finish with playback, the program will play the remaining 3 files.<br /><br />

<p><font size="+1"><b><a id="limitations">Limitations</a></b></font></p>
Manually adding files to the Queue List by drag &drop or copy/paste doesn't automatically add files to the Now Playing panel that are missing with MM older than v4.1.0.1648, so with these versions you should use the <i>Queue Selected</i> command instead.<br /><br />

<p><font size="+1"><b><a id="inikeys">Additional INI keys</a></b></font></p>
There are some keys in the [QueueList] section of the MediaMonkey.ini file for some less needed options:<br />
<li>QueuePlaylist - the name of the queue playlist; the default queue playlist is "Queue List" as a child of the Playlists node, but it could be even some nested one if you use an unique name or if you specify the full path to it using "\" as a level separator, e.g. Songs\My Queue;<br /><br />

<li>QueueSelectedHotkey - the hot-key for the <i>Queue Selected</i> command; default is F3;<br /><br />

<li>ShowQueueListHotkey - the toggle hot-key for display of the Queue List playlist; default is F4;<br /><br />

<li>DuplicatesMode - determines what happens when you apply the <i>Queue Selected</i> command or drag&drop or copy/paste with files that already exist in the Queue List playlist: 0 - do nothing, 1 - add duplicates (old behavior), 2 - remove existing (new default);<br /><br />

<li>RemoveFromNPAfterPlay - determines what happens with files added to the Now Playing panel after applying the <i>Queue Selected</i> command or drag&drop or copy/paste with files that don't exist in the Now Playing panel when they finish playing: 0 - leave them in NP (old behavior), 1 - remove them (new default).<br /><br />

The MediaMonkey.ini file is stored in the c:\Documents and Settings\User_Name\Application Data\MediaMonkey folder for MM4 and Win7. You could find the location of the .ini file depending on the version of MediaMonkey and Windows <a href="https://www.mediamonkey.com/support/knowledge-base/mediamonkey-install-config/modifying-the-mediamonkey-db-and-ini-files/">here</a>. If you want to modify any key in it using e.g. Notepad, you should do that with closed MediaMonkey application.<br />
